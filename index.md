## About Me
{: style="text-align: center !important;"}

With a solid background in agile methods and over ten years of experience using Linux, I focus on creating scalable, automated solutions in cloud-based environments (like Docker and OCI). I also enjoy setting up similar systems using spare computers and servers at home. My skills also include working with Atlassian products, and I have a proven history of managing technical projects and working with global tech teams to deliver efficient and high-performance IT solutions.

As a Senior Engineer, I have led small technical teams, driven project progress, and worked with stakeholders in high-stakes situations. My consulting background has given me the opportunity to collaborate with worldwide tech leaders, helping them improve workflows, boost productivity, and reach their IT goals.

Outside of work, I love exploring both older Unix systems and the latest Linux distributions. I’m passionate about free software and open-source technology, applying DevOps practices to personal projects and helping meet my clients' needs.
